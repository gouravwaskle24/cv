      Virat Kohli (Hindustani: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦliː] (listen); born 5 November
      1988) is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India
      national cricket team. He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and Royal
      Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League as a right-handed
      batsman. He is often considered one of the best batsmen of his era and
      some critics believe him to be one of the best limited-overs batsmen in
      history.[3] Between 2013 and 2022, he captained the India cricket team in
      213 matches across all three formats. With 40 wins out of 68 matches,
      though mostly winning at home, Kohli is one of the most successful Indian
      Test captains[4]
